    <title>Very Basic Git Commands</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>It's been a long time since I've done any coding and pushing any code to git.</p>
    <p>The first command if inititating a project is <strong>git init.</strong>  This initialises it as a git repository.</p>
    <p>This repo is empty. So we tell git that we have files that need to be tracked.  Git will add these in the next commit. We <strong>Stage</strong> the files to be tracked.  git add .</p> 
    <p>This adds all the files or you could name specific ones.</p>
    <p>git commit -m "describe what happened when this file was edited"</p>
